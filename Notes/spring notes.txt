


Spring Framework
===============
> Spring is a open source framework and it was developed to make 
	development of enterprise web application easy.

> Spring framework was developed by "Rod johnson" in the year 2003

>Current version of spring is 5.x version

> Official website of spring is www.spring.io













Features of spring framework
============================
> lightweight
> Dependency Injection (DI)/ Inversion of Control
> Aspect Oriented (AOP)
> Easy to test
> Non invasive
> Modular
> Easy Integration with other technologies like 
  hibernate, REST, JavaMail, JNDI  etc...








Spring Architecture
================
Spring consists of many modules in it 
1. Core Container
2. AOP
3. Data Access Layer
4. Web Layer
5. Test layer





Core Container
=============
> Core Container is a main component of Spring it is responsible for managing beans
> It has bean factory to create beans
> Core to add dependencies, read config files etc..
> Context holds the beans in the memory
> SpEL (Spring Expression Language) its a language used within 
  config file to refer other beans









AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming)
==============================
> it is used to create application wide services like logging, 
	security, transactions etc...
in a declarative manner without modifying the existing code.




Data Access Layer
==============
> This layer is used to communicate with any type of database
it can be relational db or nosql db (mongoDB, cassandra etc...)
> it consists of JDBC, spring provides lots of helper classes to reduce JDBC code by 50%
> it has ORM Support which helps to integrate with hibernate, JPA etc...

note: 
JDBC (Java DataBase Connectivity)
ORM (Object Relational Mapping)
OXM (Object XML Mapping)
JMS (Java Messaging Services)





Web Layer
==========
Web module supports the development of web based application
 with a help of spring MVC etc..

Test Layer
========
The Test module supports the testing of Spring components 
with JUnit or TestNG frameworks.









Spring Bean Containers/ IOC container
===============================
>The Spring container is at the core of the Spring Framework.

> The container will create the objects, wire them together and configure them.

> Spring container manages their complete life cycle from creation till destruction.

>The Spring container uses DI to manage the components that make up an application.











there are 2 types of container 

1. BeanFactory (org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanFactory)
2. ApplicationContext (org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext)










Inversion of Control
===============
Inversion of Control is a principle in software engineering by 
which the control of objects or portions of a program is 
transferred to a container or framework.


Beans: Objects that are created and managed by Spring container are called beans.













Dependency Injection(DI)/Bean Wiring
===============================
> Dependency Injection (DI) is a software design pattern that implements inversion of 
control for resolving dependencies.

> An injection is the passing of a dependency to a dependent object that would use it.

> In simple words Dependency Injection is  one of the mechanism used for initializing
   instance variables.

> Spring offers two ways to implement Dependency Injection
	1. Setter Injection: Injection of dependencies using setter method of the bean
	2. Constructor Injection: Injection of dependencies using constructors

> Using DI we can inject the folowing types of values

1. Primitives
2. String
3. Wrapper
4. Set
5. List
6. Map
7. User Defined Data types (i.e class types)




Dependency Injection of User Defined Data types
=======================================
>Dependency Injection of user defined data types is also known as "bean wiring".

>Bean wiring is a process of associating a bean. (Has-A relationship).

>Bean wiring can be done in 2 ways
	
	1.Explicit wiring: using xml(by using <property> tag for setter or <constructor-arg>
	for constructor injection).
	
	2. Implicit wiring: it can be done in 2 ways
			a. using xml(using "autowire" attribute of <bean> tag)	
			b. using annotations(using "@Autowired" spring annotation)









Explicit wiring
============
>it can be done by using "ref" attribute in both <property> and <constructor-arg>

> for setter injection 
	eg:
		 <bean id = "classA" class="org.jspiders.ClassA"/>
	     	 <bean id="classB" class="org.jspiders.ClassB">
			<property name = "a" ref="classA"/>
	     	 </bean>	

>for constructor injection
	eg:
		 <bean id = "classA" class="org.jspiders.ClassA"/>
	     	 <bean id="classB" class="org.jspiders.ClassB">
			<constructor-arg name="a" ref="classA"/>
	     	 </bean>




			
Implicit wiring(Bean Autowiring)
==========================
> The major drawback of explicit wiring is the bean wiring has to be done 
  explicitly by the developer and requires 
  too much of xml configuring for registering the beans and for wiring.

>if we use implicit wiring/autowiring container takes care of wiring

> it can be done in 2 ways
	
xml configuration(using autowire attribute in <bean>)
==========================================
>In this approach we register the beans is configuration xml file and the wiring will be 
done implicitly by the container.
>Eg: <bean id="classA" autowire="autowireType"/>





-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| autowiretype	|	how wiring will be done											|            
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|1.  no			| No implicit wiring will be done perform only explicit wiring. 	| 
|																					|
|2. byName		| property name in the bean class and and bean id should be same	|
|				|	(Setter injection will be used).								|
|3.byType		|  property type in the bean class and type in the bean should be	|
|				|	same (Setter injection will be used).							|   
|4. constructor	|  parameter type of the constructor and bean type should be same	|	
|				|																	|
|5. default		| it depends on the default-autowire attribute in <beans> tag.		|
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






Implicit wiring using annotations
==========================
> The basic idea of annotation is to avoid too much of lines in 
  a xml (which looks complicated)

> It helps to do configuration in the same java file instead of using 
  external files like (xml file)

> to enable annotation in spring use <context: annotation-config/> 
  tag in the configuration xml file.

> implicit wiring or autowiring can be done using any of the below approach
	> Spring annotations (@Autowired)
	> Java annotations(@Inject)

a. Using spring annotation "@Autowired"
======================================
> @Autowired annotation will do  autowiring byType;
> @Autowired annotation can be applied to
	1. fields
	2. constructor
	3. setter
	4. arbitrary methods

b. Using java annotation "@Inject"
============================
> @Inject is same as @Autowired
> @Inject will do autowiring byType.
>  this  annotation can be applied to
	1. fields
	2. constructor
	3. setter
	4. arbitrary methods




Component Scanning
=================
> It is a mechanism used to detect and register 
  the beans in the spring container automatically

  >Generally we always register beans in xml file using <bean> tag 

> In large applications it becomes tedious to configure all the beans in xml file 
  and maintanence of this bean becomes difficult.

> An alternative for this problem is "component scanning"

> In component scanning container automatically detects the bean and creates the bean.

> to do component scanning, beans should be marked with below annotations
	1. spring "@Component"
	2. java "@Named"


To perform component scanning using  annotation
==============================================
step 1: use the tag <context: component-scan base-package="pkgNm"/> 
		in the configuration xml file and specify the package to be 
		scanned using "base-package" attribute

Note: 	<context: component-scan> tag automatically enables annotation and 
		also searches and creates the bean in the specified packages.

step 2: use the annotation @Component (for spring)/ @Named (for java) on the 
		class which has to be marked as bean, this annotation 
		marks the class as an auto detectable bean
	
	eg 1: for spring configuration
			package edu.jspiders;
			import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;
			
			@Component
			public class A
			{
				// code goes here
			}


	eg 2: for java configuration
			package edu.jspiders
			import javax.inject.Named;
			
			@inject
			public class A
			{
				// code goes here
			}



Q1. What is the difference between <context:annotation-config/> and 
<context: component-scan/>?
ans:  <context: annotation-config/> tag only activates or enables the annotations.
         <context: component-scan/> tag enables annotations
		 and also scans the specified packages to create the bean.








Q2. Difference between constructor injection and setter injection
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|	setter injection						|	constructor injection					|
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| 1. it uses setter method to do dependency	| 1. it uses constructor to do dependency	|
|	 injection								|	 injection								|
| 2. setter injection is used for optional	| 2. constructor injection is used 			|
|	 dependencies							| 	 for mandatory dependencies.			|
| 3. Dependency injection might fail		| 3. object will never be created until the	|
| 	 and an object might be created without	|    dependency is ready  since the			|
|	 initialisation.						| 	 constructor is invoked.				|
|											|											|

Some important annotations of Spring
==============================
@Configuration: this annotation is used to let Spring know that it’s a Configuration class.

@ComponentScan:this  annotation is used with @Configuration annotation 
to specify the packages to look for Component classes.

@Bean: this annotation is used to let Spring framework know that this method 
should be used to get the bean implementation to inject in Component classes.

@Value: this  annotation provides a convenient way to inject property 
		values into components.

@Qualifier: this  annotation is used along with @Autowired to remove 
		the confusion by specifying which exact bean will be wired.

@Required : This  annotation is applied to bean property setter methods.




Bean scopes in Spring
==================
Spring has 5 types of scopes
1. Singleton(default): in this scope only one instance will be created 
	for the given class and will return same instance whenever we call getBean(). 
2. prototype: when we specify scope as "prototype", a new instance will be 
	created everytime we call a getBean().
3. request: creates a bean instance per HTTP request, this scope can only be 
			used with web apps.
4. session: creates a bean instance per HTTP session, this scope can only be 
			used with web apps.
5. globalSession: creates a bean per global HTTP session. this scope is only applicable 
				for portlet applications.

Note: Scopes can be declared either in xml configuration or annotations. 

eg for setting scope using xml:

<bean id="classA" class="edu.jspiders.ClassA" scope="singleton"/>

eg for setting scope using annotation

@Component
@Scope("singleton")
class ClassA
{
	// some code
}


Life cycle of Spring Bean 
====================
> Bean Life cycle is controlled by Container i.e from bean 
  instantiation to bean destruction.

> Life cyle of bean is very easy to understand

> Once the bean is instantiated it needs some properties or 
  dependencies to be initialised to make bean a usable object.

> Once the bean is no longer required it should be removed from the container
  for this some clean up code is required.

> The life cycle of beans consist of call back methods which can be categorized 
  broadly in two groups:
	a. Post initialization call back methods
	b. Pre destruction call back methods

Life cycles methods of spring bean
===========================
>It can be declared in any of the following way

1. programmatic
2. declarative


> life cycle methods using programmatic way  is "afterPropertiesSet()" and "destroy()"
> it can be used by implementing 2 interfaces
	a. InitializingBean
	b. DisposableBean

> InitializingBean interface declares afterPropertiesSet() which is executed 
	during the creation of bean instance.We can write any initializing logic here.  
> DisposableBean interface has destroy() which is executed before the destruction of bean. We can write any
	cleanup logic in this method.
> However this approach is not recommended as it is invasive and will 
	create tight coupling with spring framework.



> In a Declarative way we can write our methods and make them as custom life cycle methods with a 
  configurations.

> declarative is non invasive which is recommended
> configurations can be done in 2 ways i.e either by xml or annotations

using xml
========
> write your own methods and specify that as life cycle method in a xml  file.
> using "init-method" or "destroy-method"  attribute inside <bean> tag.

> eg: <bean id="classA" class="edu.jspiders.ClassA" scope="singleton" 
       init-method="myInit" destroy-method="myDestroy"/>

using annotations
==============
> write your own methods and specify them as life cyle methods using annotations 
  "@PostConstruct" and "@PreDestroy"

> both @PostConstruct and @PreDestory are java configured annotations.

> the method which is annotated with @PostConstruct annotation will execute 
  after the creation of bean.

> the method which is annotated with @PreDestroy annotation will execute 
  during the destruction of bean.

>eg:
	package edu.jspiders.dto;
	import javax.annotation.PostConstruct;
	import javax.annotation.PreDestroy;

	@Component
	public class ClassA
	{
		@PostConstruct
		public void myInit() throws Exception
		{
			// some initialization code 
		}

		@PreDestroy
		public void myDestroy() throws Exception
		{
			// some cleanup code
		}
	}//end of class

	
	
	
	
	
	
	
BeanPostProcessor
===============
> A bean post processor allows additional processing before and after the bean 
initialization callback method.
> if we want to have common processing logic for multiple beans then we can implement 
"org.springframework.beans.factory.config.BeanPostProcessor" interface.













> eg: 
	package edu.jspiders.dto;
	import org.springframework.beans.BeansException;
	import org.springframework.beans.factory.config.BeanPostProcessor;

	@Component
	public class ClassB implements BeanPostProcessor
	{	
		@Override
		public Object postProcessBeforeInitialization(Object bean, String beanNm)
			throws BeansException
		{
			//initialization code goes here
			return bean;
		}//end of method
		
		@Override
		public Object postProcessAfterInitialization(Object bean, String beanNm)
			throws BeansException
		{
			//initialization code goes here
			return bean;
		}//end of method
	}//end of class
