---------------------

They are a large Bodies (set of built-In classes and libraries and interfaces)
of pre-written code which helps us to perform a task 
efficiently with the reduction of Boiler Plate Code.

With the help of FrameWorks the work of the Developer to write the number of lines
reduces and it makes application implementation as well as code look easy
and simple.












Different Types of Java FrameWorks
----------------------------------

1. Spring and Spring MVC.
2. Structs.
3. Hibernate.
4. JSF.
5. Google Web Toolkit.
6. Vaaldin.
7. Grails.

etc....










Hibernate
=========

Hibernate ORM (Hibernate in short) is an object-relational 
mapping tool for the Java programming language.
It provides a framework for mapping an object-oriented domain 
model to a relational database. 

Hibernate handles object-relational impedance mismatch 
problems by replacing direct, persistent database accesses 
with high-level object handling functions.

It is an open source persistent framework created by Gavin King in 2001.











Why Go For Hibernate ???
========================

When we work with an object-oriented system, 
there is a mismatch between the object model 
and the relational database.



We End Up With

G I I A N

G --> Granularity

I --> Inheritance

I --> Identity

A --> Associations

N --> Navigation


This is the Reason we make use of Object to Relational Mapping.









What is ORM ?
-------------

It is a programming technique for converting 
data between relational 
databases and object oriented programming 
languages such as Java, C#, etc.











Advantages of ORM...
--------------------

1. Letâ€™s business code access objects rather than DB tables.
2. Hides details of SQL queries from OO logic.
3. Internally Based on JDBC.
4. No need to deal with the database implementation.
5. Entities based on business concepts rather than database structure.
6. Fast development of application.









Reason to Go for Hibernate..
----------------------------

1. Hibernate makes our application code independent of DB.
2. Hibernate significantly reduce development time & 
   reduces the complex data access code.
3. Hibernate takes care of mapping java classes to DB tables.
4. Hibernate takes care of converting the ResultSet data into 
   simple Java Object.
5. Basic to less knowledge of SQL is required. Hibernate internally takes care 
   of issuing SQL Queries specific to underlying DB.
6. Maintenance of the application is easier.
